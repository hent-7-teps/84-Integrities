33. Memory:
Visual correlations of the color spectrum are the transit bridge to coordinate memory and distance.

34. Synonyms:
Do not heed what I do, for I do not heed you.
A witty firewall protects from unintentional initiated sequences.

35. Fortification:
Every body propels a forcefield, not like the spear, but of a gravitational perspective.  Mercury in retrograde.

36. Terror:
Vestigially we are camped in uproot set at the Rulers ground.

37. Pain:
The inertia caused by the effect of a stabilized compound, quickly lapses in two’s while closing seams.

38. Relief:
Waves in alignment channel frequency, holding barometric qualities along passage.

39. Absorption:
Radiant properties of the Sun’s electrons have shown near consistent levels for ages.

40. Mother:
Memories of infantile states in humanity haven’t been repeated since the Big Bang.

41. Protection:
I keep it to myself, this hell, and prevail.  Focusing positive energy along the way.

42. Security:
Witnesses safely stood wondering where the alcohol is plentiful from popular deliverers.  The tight weave of a spun thread guides proximity indicators.

43. Secrets:
Pizza Parties set asunder a synthesized situation.

44. Humor:
Contractual obligation is best securely vested with monetary equilibrium and taxable brass.

45. Sportsmanship:
Naturally, he stalks his prey, knowing he must pounce and jostle it down to standard. 

46. Strive:
Going for the hub is an endless vanity until you achieve informative interface.
They are in earshot.
